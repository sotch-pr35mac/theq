	<h4>About TheQ</h4>
	<p>TheQ is a virtual line designed to streamline the repair process. Devices are organized by promised time and marked urgent (red ticket number) when the current time and the repair time (time it takes to perform a given repair) added together reach the promised time. Click on a ticket number in the line to see it in RepairQ, see who started a repair or start a repair yourself. The possibilities are endless. For more information visit the <a href="/updates">Planned Updates</a> page.</p>

	<!-- Release Notes -->
	<h4>Release Notes</h4>
	<p><b>In this release:</b> TheQ v1.0.3 brings a major UI overhaul based on a design paradigm by <a href="http://steventhanna.github.io">Steven Hanna</a>. v1.0.3 inherits most updates from v1.0.2.</p>
	<p><b>In the previous release:</b> in v1.0.2 we revamped the navigation bar at the top to include 3 sections, Add, View, and Settings. In addition to being able to add devices to the line from the add section, you can now also add store wide alerts. Other links in the navbar have been consoldated into the View section, including viewing the line. The settings section now lets you clear defaults in case you move to a new store location, or you want to change your name that gets logged as a technician. </p>
