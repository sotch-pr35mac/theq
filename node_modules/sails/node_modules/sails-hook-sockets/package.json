While the \"patch\" version (i.e. the \"Z\" in \"X.Y.Z\") will normally differ from that of Sails core, the \"minor\" version number (i.e. the \"Y\" in \"X.Y.Z\") of this hook is also the minor version of Sails for which it is designed.  For instance, if a hook is version `0.11.9`, it is designed for Sails `^0.11.0` (that means it'll work from 0.11.0 all the way up until 0.12.0).\n\n#### Does this hook use Socket.io v1.0?\n\nYes.\n\n#### Are there changes?\n\nYes, see the [v0.11 migration guide](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Upgrading). You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.\n\n\n## Running the tests\n\nFirst, clone this repo, cd into it, and install dependencies:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.git\ncd sails-hook-sockets\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### Run them all\n\nTo run all the tests, start a local redis server on port 6380 and then run the tests using mocha:\n\n```sh\nredis-server --port 6380\nnpm test\n```\n\n\n#### Run only certain tests\n\nAlternatively, you can run a particular set of tests with:\n\n```sh\nnode ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g 'without session'\n```\n\n> (this may be useful if you don't want to wait for all the tests to run, or e.g. if you aren't able to install a redis server locally.  However please make sure all the tests pass before submitting a PR.)\n\n\n\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
